# Smiley

It is only a funny app. If you click to screen, the Smiley start to turn around itself. If you click to screen again, the Smiley stop. It is so basic.

# Setup

I develop the project with tornado and pixi.js. So I used python in Backend and pure JS in Frontend. 

I assume you setup python and npm your own computer. Now, You setup pixi.js and tornado.

Install tornado with pip:

```
pip install tornado
```

Install pixijs with npm:

```
npm install pixi.js
```

Finally, you need a webpack. Install webpack with npm:
```
npm install webpack webpack-cli -g
```

Webpack running with:
```
webpack
```
or(IDK)
```
npm run build
```

Run the `__init__.py` file and open http://localhost:8888/
